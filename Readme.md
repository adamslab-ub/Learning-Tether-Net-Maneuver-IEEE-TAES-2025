# Surrogate-aided-Learning-of-Tether-Net
In this paper, we proposed a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning method to find the thrust angles and magnitude to maneuver the tether-net system to achieve successful captures with low fuel cost.

This repo contains the supplement materials for the paper:
